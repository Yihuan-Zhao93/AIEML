# About AIEML
We constructed a dataset of 3,074 AIE/ACQ molecules, built a prediction model with an independent test set accuracy of up to 0.974 using the ensemble learning algorithm LightGBM and joint molecular fingerprints as inputs, and validated the extrapolation ability of the optimal model through out-of-sample validation (accuracy = 0.963).

# Requirements:
* Python 3.9.12
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* 
The files AIE727x.xlsx correspond to the inputs of the models constructed for AIE.
File AIE727y.xlsx serves as the output for the ML model construction.
80AIEYZ.xlsx contains detailed inputs information on 80 recently reported fluorescent organic compounds.
AIEYZinformation.xlsx contains detailed information on 80 recently reported fluorescent organic compounds, 25,006 commercially available compounds and 520 new designed molecules.
