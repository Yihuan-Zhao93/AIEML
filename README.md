We constructed a dataset of 3,074 AIE/ACQ molecules, built a prediction model with an independent test set accuracy of up to 0.974 using the ensemble learning algorithm LightGBM and joint molecular fingerprints as inputs, and validated the extrapolation ability of the optimal model through out-of-sample validation (accuracy = 0.963).
